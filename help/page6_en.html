    <h1> Queries  </h1>
	<p>
		A right click on the project level allows the creation of queries, symbolised by a green pyramid.

		The FROM statement must be entered manually, in case of complicated queries it can be copied from the query manager of GeODin.

		</br>
		The query must be executed by the user by opening the right click menu of the query. If successful, the object tree expands automatically, showing all objects matching this query.
		</br>
		</br>
		Custom queries, which were created in GeODin, are automatically imported to QGIS. The symbol is a yellow pyramid. These queries must be executed manually as well.
		</br>
		</br>
		As queries act as object groups they can be added to the QGIS map canvas.
		</br>
		</br>
		If the GeODin query contains result fields, they are transferred to QGIS in the background. They will be appended to the attribute table, if the objects are added to QGIS as a vector file.
